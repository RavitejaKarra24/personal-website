    Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born German politician who was dictator of
    Germany from 1933 until his death in 1945.

    <h1 id="about">Facts about the legend</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>He was Austrian</h3>
        <p>
          The fact that Hitler was Austrian, born in Braunau am Inn in April
          1889, might seem odd given his association with German nationalism.
          This affinity was not, however, all that unusual among Austrians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Influenced by the tutelage of his high school teacher, Leopold
          Poetsch, who had strong German nationalist sensibilities (and also
          taught Aldolf Eichmann), Hitler grew to despise the Austro-Hungarian
          Empire and express loyalty only to Germany. In 1914, while living in
          Munich, Hitler managed to enlist in the Bavarian Army before
          renouncing his Austrian citizenship in 1925 and officially becoming
          a German citizen in the early 30s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the family moving from Braunau am Inn to Linz when Adolf was
          three years old, the border town and the house that he was born in
          (but only stayed in for a couple of weeks) have a lasting issue with
          their connection to Hitler.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>He was a frustrated artist</h3>
        <p>
          It’s tempting to wonder how different the 20th century might have
          been had Hitler’s youthful aspirations to become an artist been
          realised. He twice failed the entrance exam of the Academy of Fine
          Arts in Vienna (in 1907 and in 1908) when it was noted that, though
          he had some talent for architectural draughtsmanship, his human
          figures lacked detail and characterHitler’s interest in art did
          continue, however. So-called ‘degenerate’ modern, abstract and
          impressionist art was denounced as the product of Jewish and
          Bolshevik artists during the Third Reich.
        </p>
        <p>
          The works, some by world famous artists like Klee and Picasso, were
          removed from German museums and placed in a condemnatory exhibition.
          The Nazis also collected significant and invaluable pieces of art,
          often in the name of ‘kunstschutz’ – art protection. This process
          was decreed by the Hague Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs
          of War on Land (1899 and 1907), but excess looting took place in
          occupied zones and the collections of targeted minorities were
          confiscated. A Führermuseum was to be constructed in Linz, Austria,
          after the war but some of the artworks were taken into the private
          collections of Hitler, Göring and Goebbels. 1.4 million train
          carriages worth of art was taken, and up to 100,000 pieces are still
          unaccounted for.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>He once lived in a homeless shelter</h3>
        <p>
          Hitler’s failure to make it as an artist had grave financial
          consequences. Having had little success selling his paintings,
          postcards and advertisements, his financial resources were so
          seriously diminished that he lived in a homeless shelter in Vienna
          in December 1909. He then lived in a public dormitory for men until
          1913, when he received his father’s inheritance and moved to Munich.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>He was wounded in the First World War</h3>
        <p>
          Whilst still an Austrian citizen, Adolf Hitler was accepted into the
          Bavarian army. He served in the infantry at the First Battle of
          Ypres, where the new infantry divisions suffered casualties as high
          as one third to a half. After this battle he was made regimental
          message runner; it has been suggested that this was a relatively
          safe role, largely taking place away from the front. Despite this
          Hitler took a wound on his leg at the Battle of the Somme in 1916,
          and was temporarily blinded by mustard gas in 1918. Whilst
          recovering from the latter injury Hitler heard the news of the
          German surrender and armistice.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>He served time for high treason</h3>
        <p>
          Two days after a failed coup by the Nazi party in 1923, remembered
          as the Beer Hall or Munich Putsch, Hitler was arrested for treason
          for his leading role. Hitler was tried by judges sympathetic to his
          beliefs and given a five year sentence with no forced labour and the
          right to regular visitors. He served less than a year of his
          sentence and used the time to begin writing Mein Kampf, his
          chronicle and doctrine, more than five million copies of which would
          sell by 1939. Hitler’s trial was highly publicised, and he used it
          to propagate his ideas of right-wing nationalism, and to blame
          Germany’s post-war problems on Jews, Socialists and the French.
